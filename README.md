# 🏥 End-to-End Healthcare Data Analysis using Python

A comprehensive data analysis project focused on hospital admissions, billing patterns, patient outcomes, and operational efficiency using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
This project uncovers actionable insights that can help healthcare providers optimize resources, reduce costs, and improve patient care.

## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare organizations generate vast amounts of data across admissions, treatments, billing, and outcomes.
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory and analytical study to answer key operational and financial questions such as:

* Which admission types dominate hospital inflow?

* Which hospitals handle the highest patient volume?

* What medical conditions drive the highest billing?

* How does length of stay vary by age, admission type, and condition?

* What patterns exist in test results and outcomes?

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains comprehensive patient-level healthcare records, covering multiple dimensions of hospital operations:

* Admissions – Emergency, Urgent, and Elective cases

* Hospitals & Doctors – Provider and facility information

* Billing – Treatment and hospitalization costs

* Insurance Providers – Coverage and billing impact

* Medical Conditions – Diagnosis-level insights

* Test Results – Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive outcomes

* Length of Stay – Hospitalization duration

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
## 1️⃣ Admission & Hospital Operations

* Admission type distribution (Emergency / Urgent / Elective)

* Monthly admission trends and seasonality

* Hospitals with the highest number of admissions

* Load concentration across high-volume hospitals

### Insight:
Elective admissions account for nearly 50% of total inflow, while a small number of hospitals handle ~60% of total admissions, indicating capacity pressure on major facilities.

## 2️⃣ 💰 Billing & Cost Analysis

* Average, minimum, and maximum billing amounts

* Medical conditions with the highest average billing

* Billing comparison by admission type

* Insurance provider–wise billing trends

* Identification of top high-cost patient cases

### Insight:
Billing ranges from $1,003 for routine procedures to $52,764 for complex ICU and surgical cases. Chronic and emergency conditions are major cost drivers.

## 3️⃣ ⏱ Length of Stay Analysis

* Overall average length of stay

* Length of stay by:

** Admission type

Medical condition

Age group

Comparison of elderly vs younger patients

### Insight:
Patients aged 65+ stay ~40% longer, and emergency admissions result in significantly extended hospital stays—directly impacting cost and resource utilization.

## 4️⃣ 🧪 Test Results & Patient Outcomes
